This app is an example of how to use Jasmine to test applications.  
Usually test should be written before the code is written but in this case the test
was written after the application had been finished.

To view the application:

1.) clone the project using github or download it
2.) copy the full path of the index.html file
3.) paste the index.html file into the browser and the Udacity feedreader will appear
4.) click the hamburger on the left side to see the menu and pick blogs from other topics
to read
5.) look at the bottom with the jasmine status window displays the different test that have been
performed and that all the test have been passed or are 'green'.
